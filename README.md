## About
A calculator for RS3 revolution bars. 
It contains some weird and probably slow code but, not to take away from the original project's value as 
I couldn't have done something like this with my current skills.  
I have just updated what I can so that the program functions using up to date skills and numbers.  
I am currently working on learning combinatorial optimisation algorithms/information and my plan is to subsequently use that knowledge to rewrite this program to be able to solve for a greater number of abilities at once (in a feasible time frame) and include more abilities.  
Runs on python3.  

## Calculated Bars
Bars are calculated by first getting a number of the highest DPT abilities and then feeding them to the program.  
Disclaimer: I will add bars as I calculate them but, I will only calculate them as I need them.

## Todo:
* [ ] Learn about combinatorial optimisation.
* [ ] Learn about combinatorial search algorithms to decide which would be best suited for this purpose.
* [ ] Learn how to implement them in python.
* [ ] Make calculator for average DPT with any given input abilities.
* [ ] Adapt calculator to run permutations on a set of input abilities.
* [ ] Integrate the combinatorial search algorithm into the permutation runner.
* [ ] Once all the above is complete, cross my fingers and hope Jagex doesn't add a new mechanic.
