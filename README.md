## About
A calculator for RS3 revolution bars. 
It contains some weird and probably slow code but, not to take away from the original project's value as 
I couldn't have done something like this with my current skills.  
I have just updated what I can so that the program functions using up to date skills and numbers.  
I am currently working on learning combinatorial optimisation algorithms/information and my plan is to subsequently use that knowledge to rewrite this program to be able to solve for a greater number of abilities at once (in a feasible time frame) and include more abilities.  
Runs on python3.  

## Calculated Bars
Disclaimer: I will add bars as I calculate them but, I will only calculate them as I need them.
